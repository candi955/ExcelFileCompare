# ExcelFileCompare
# This is an admin-only file; it is meant to show if there are any differences on eight different Excel reports
# For each set of reports (before and after reports), this program is being utilized to determine if there is a
# difference between two excel files, and output those files to a specific folder.
# Two Input files are compared, and the changes Populate in an Output Excel file (it helps to check the Output file-
# table filters for worksheets with large data)
# to the general output folder
# This program utilizes the modules Pandas, and XlsxWriter
